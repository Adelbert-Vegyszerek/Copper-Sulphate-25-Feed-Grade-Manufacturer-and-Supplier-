Copper Sulphate 25% Feed Grade: Boosting Livestock Health with Adelbert Vegyszerek
When it comes to ensuring the optimal health and productivity of your livestock, the importance of essential minerals cannot be overlooked.

Our high-quality copper sulphate supplement ensures your poultry and livestock receive the vital nutrients they need for robust growth and productivity.
Why Copper is Vital for Livestock Health
Copper plays a key role in numerous physiological processes in animals, including:
1. Bone Development: Essential for maintaining strong skeletal health.
2. Immune Function: Boosts immunity, helping animals fight off infections.
3. Enzyme Activity: Involved in the activation of several enzymes critical for digestion and metabolism.
4. Pigmentation & Hair Quality: Supports healthy coat color and texture, particularly in ruminants.
Deficiencies in copper can lead to anemia, poor growth rates, weakened immunity, and reduced fertility, making copper supplementation a necessary aspect of animal feed.
